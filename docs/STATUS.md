## Follow-up: upstream engine final qualification — November 1, 20:18 UTC

The user requests a clean solution without a custom numerical workaround.
The old native F16 alternative FAILED its fresh test (two new prompts differ in
all five repetitions), despite passing the small development screen. No training
or baseline migration was started; evidence is preserved in
`experiments/clean-baseline-20261101/f16-rejection.json`.

Unmodified upstream vLLM0.32.0, retained Qwen3-4B BF16 and ordinary AngelSlim
EAGLE3 passed a 24-prompt development gate with positive draft acceptance and
exact token/text/stop equality under its supported batch-invariant mode.
Separate environment `runs/clean-engine-qualification-20261101/venv`; original
training environment untouched. No engine source patch or custom binary port.
Two failed preparation attempts (client API return type, long IPC path) are
preserved; fixed using normal API and documented RPC path setting.

Fresh final confirmation is ACTUALLY running as
`runs/local-vllm-final-20261101-01/state.json`, same-named tmux session on local
socket `binary-eagle-runtime`; root owns GPU launch/stop. It runs five alternating
repetitions over 24 fresh prompts in four cells (stock/invariant × target/EAGLE),
plus 24 independent quality cases per cell. Expected480 performance and96 quality
requests. Source/settings/model files froze before fresh inputs; each quality
control actually passed/rejected. Full public LLM.generate wall is measured,
not HTTP capacity; loading, JIT and warmups are separate. Stop/identity details
are in the run directory; global pause and local STOP check between requests.

No final correctness/quality/speed claim or engine migration is made yet.
This qualifies an ordinary upstream foundation only. Binary integration and a
same-engine primary Q4_0 control would still need review before a project switch.

## Local RTX 5080 investigation completed — November 1, 2026

The requested runtime and training-transfer investigation reached its bounded
end goal. The isolated CUDA candidate improves Qwen3.5 MTP full-request
throughput by 32.0–51.0% over the conservative workaround across 4B/9B Q4_K_M
and NVFP4. Five alternating repetitions of 24 fresh prompts per cell produced
1,920 exact token/text/stop matches, with unchanged acceptance counters. All
candidate quality outputs match the conservative control (47/96 passing cases);
absolute quality remains modest. This is opt-in runtime evidence, not a
W1A1/Q4_0 EAGLE win or output equivalence to the unmodified default backend.

The upstream quantized-KV fix does not replace our F16-KV path, and the GB10
warp override does not act on RTX 5080. The validated candidate instead combines
restored two-column vector attention with grouped quantized projections while
retaining the conservative floating paths, fusion disable and one-partition
attention. Changes remain isolated and reviewable; parent gitlink unchanged.

Historical F16-target work stays separate. Improved difficult-state scores hide
losses on previously successful continuations and extra verifier rounds. A
96-state identical-input native replay retains most of those losses, supporting
a model tradeoff rather than history differences alone. Replay fidelity is
bounded. The justified next training experiment balances actual serving-history
coverage, successful-prefix retention and acceptance/depth weighting at matched
exposure, with original-group splits and fresh full-request confirmation.
No new training, restart or shortened historical allocation occurred.

[Full findings and patch](../experiments/local-resume-20261101/runtime-and-transfer.md),
[recomputable confirmation](../experiments/local-resume-20261101/confirmation-summary.json),
[cost ledger](../experiments/local-resume-20261101/cost-summary.json), and the
[latest goal checkpoint](goals/nine-model-qat-overnight.md#final-confirmation-and-release--november-1-2026)
retain details. The broader nine-model history is preserved; this checkpoint
does not declare every historical campaign complete.

Final confirmation ended at 10:53 UTC with exit zero. Root rechecked the
recorded boot/birth identities and absent process groups; all owned supervisors
are terminal and no CUDA compute application is listed. The RTX 5080 is idle
apart from Windows graphics allocations. No worker owns a GPU job. Current
release and retention evidence are ignored files under
`runs/upstream-consistency-20261101/{release-proof,retained-inventory}.json`.
About 12.1 GB of useful captures, arrays, source and build cache is retained;
paid checkpoints and pre-existing dirty/shared files are protected. No push.

This project runs directly in WSL on the RTX 5080 machine from
`/home/philip/binary-eagle-decoding`. Use the local shell and GPU; no SSH route,
host registry, machine link or device checkout is required. Follow
[local execution](AGENT_OPERATIONS.md#local-gpu-execution). The earlier access
blocker was incorrect; declining the unnecessary link card did not pause work.
[Archived status](STATUS_HISTORY.md) preserves earlier evidence as history,
not current jobs or launch instructions. Q4_0 EAGLE remains the primary EAGLE
comparison baseline. New runtime changes require revalidation.
